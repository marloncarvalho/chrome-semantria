What is Semantria? 
-----------------
Semantria is a Sentiment Analysis tool available at http://www.semantria.com/. Haven't you ever heard about Sentiment Analysis tools? So Google it. :)

-------------
1. Get registered at the Semantria website. Once registered, they'll provide you a Key and Secret. Get note of it, you'll need to provide it at the options page.
2. Google Chrome installed. :P

Usage
------
First off, clone this repository. At Google Chrome, go to the Extensions Page, click "Load unpacked extension..." and point to the folder where you've just cloned this repository. You'll be asked to provide your Key and Secret. Access any web page, select any text and "right click" it. You'll probably see a "Sentiment Analysis by Semantria" option!
